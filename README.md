.NET Core Finding Maximum path of Orthogonal Triangle

## How it works and rules
Getting orthogonal triangle input from a file, and finding the maximum sum of the numbers according to given rules below:

	- Starting from the top, and move downwards to an adjacent numbers as in below.
	- Only allowed to walk downwards and diagonally.
	- Only walk over NON PRIME NUMBERS.
	- Have to reach at the end of the pyramid as much as possible.
	- Have to treat the input as pyramid.
	According to above rules the maximum sum of the numbers from top to bottom in below example is 24.
	                      *1
	                     *8 4
	                    2 *6 9
	                   8 5 *9 3 	
	As you see 1,8,6,9 are all NOT PRIME NUMBERS, and walking over these yields the maximum sum.
